# Einstein is a NewtonOS emulator.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pguyot/Einstein.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pguyot/Einstein)

Einstein officially runs on OS X with partial support for iOS, Android, Linux and Windows.  Currently, it requires a ROM image dumped from an actual Newton (not included in this repository).

You should refer to the wiki for [build instructions](../../wiki/Build-Instructions)

Once you have the build up and running, refer to the [user manual](https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual.pdf).
